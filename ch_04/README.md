# Chapter 4. Expressions

## Exercise 4.1

> What is the value returned by 5 + 10 * 20/2?

105

## Exercise 4.2

> Using Table 4.12 (p. 166), parenthesize the following expressions to indicate the order in which the operands are grouped:
>
> ```cpp
> * vec.begin() //=> *(vec.begin())
> * vec.begin() + 1 //=> (*(vec.begin())) + 1
> ```

## Exercise 4.3

> Order of evaluation for most of the binary operators is left undefined to give the compiler opportunities for optimization. This strategy presents a trade-off between efficient code generation and potential pitfalls in the use of the language by the programmer. Do you consider that an acceptable trade-off? Why or why not?

我认为可以接受，使用的时候注意就行了。
